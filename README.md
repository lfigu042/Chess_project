# Chess_project
Program that stores a chessboard in a 2D array of integers.
A chessboard can be represented by an 8 Ã— 8 table of integers in which every cell is corresponding to one of the 64 squares of the board and determines the occupant of the square.
If the value of a table cell is zero, it means that the square corresponding to that cell is empty. If the value is positive, it means that a white piece occupies the corresponding
square; while a negative value means that the occupying piece color is black.
